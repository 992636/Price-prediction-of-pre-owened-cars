**Overview**
This repository contains code for a machine learning model designed to predict the price of pre-owned cars.
The model is trained on a dataset of historical car listings, incorporating features such as make, model, year, mileage,
and other relevant factors to provide an accurate estimation of a car's value.

**Files**
train.py: This script contains the code for training the machine learning model using the provided dataset.
predict.py: This script allows users to input car features and obtain a predicted price for the pre-owned vehicle.
data.csv: This CSV file contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.It includes features such as make, model, year, mileage, price, etc.

**Dependencies**
The following dependencies are required to run the scripts:
Python (>= 3.6)
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn

**Dataset**
The dataset (cars.csv) used for training the model contains historical data of pre-owned car listings.
It includes various features such as make, model, year, mileage, price, etc. Ensure that the dataset is properly formatted and contains relevant information for accurate model training.
Model Evaluation
The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
These metrics provide insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data and predicts the prices of pre-owned cars.
